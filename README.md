This Python project scrapes, processes, and organizes data about films and their critics from the BBC's "21st Centuryâ€™s 100 Greatest Films" article. The data is then cleaned, analyzed, and prepared for further exploration, including extracting director information from IMDb.

Things I did in this project:
Scraping: Extracts film, director, and critic information from the BBC article.
Regex: Cleans and organizes data using regular expressions.
Data Cleaning: Handles multiple directors, corrects anomalies, and prepares data for analysis.
IMDb Integration: Fetches additional director details (birthplace and gender) from IMDb.
